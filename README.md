# Potato-Organ
Capacitive Midi Controller based on the MPR121 chip.

The repository can be opened directly using **PlatformIO**.
If you want to use the **ArduinoIDE** instead, open up the "Potato_Organ/Potato_Organ.ino" file.

Make sure to install the `Adafruit_MPR121` and `FastLED` libraries in both cases.
